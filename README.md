After building KNN, DecisionTree, SVM, and logistic models based on what I learned through class, I downloaded the test data, dropped unnecessary columns, one-hot and binary encoded education and gender columns respectively, and normalized the features. Based on the models I built by training on the training data provided, I predicted results using the test data I preprocessed and presented the F1 score/Jaccard/LogLoss scores in a table.
